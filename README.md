# Emergency-Vehicle-Detection-and-Classification
This project focuses on the detection and classification of emergency vehicles using deep learning techniques. 
The project uses a trained MobileNetV2 model to accurately identify vehicles like normal, police, ambulances, and fire trucks, processing video inputs and sending notifications when an emergency vehicle is detected.
